## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular method for securely transmitting information between parties. In web applications, JWTs are commonly used for authentication purposes, allowing users to obtain and transmit digitally signed tokens that assert certain claims.

This project serves as a practical example of implementing JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application. It demonstrates how to generate JWT tokens upon user login, securely transmit and store those tokens, and validate them to authenticate subsequent requests.

## Features

- User authentication using JWT tokens.
- Token generation and validation.
- Secure transmission of tokens over HTTP headers.
